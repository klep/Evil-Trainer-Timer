I frequently accuse my personal trainer of using a fake iOS timer when I'm doing a plank, wall sit, or something equally painful and boring.

Of course, she wasn't doing that. But now she _could_ using Evil Trainer Timer.

In Evil mode, it will add an imperceptible ~15% extra duration to each reported "second", so you get an extra 10 seconds of workout for every "minute" on the timer.

This was cobbled together and probably doesn't display correctly on some devices.
